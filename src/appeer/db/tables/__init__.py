"""Handling of SQL tables

The allowed table names and columns are given in ``registered_tables.py``.

The modules should be named identically as the allowed table names and
contain a class called the same as the table name, with removed underscores
and the first letter of each word capitalized.

Some examples:

Table         Module            Class
------------------------------------------
scrape_jobs   scrape_jobs.py    ScrapeJobs
scrape        scrape.py         Scrape
